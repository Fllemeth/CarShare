				<p class="h1">What is a car sharing?</p>
				<p class="text">Сar sharing is like a car rent, but where people rent cars for short periods of time, often by the hour. It differs from traditional car rental in that the owners of the cars are often private individuals themselves, and the carsharing facilitator is generally distinct from the car owner. Carsharing is part of a larger trend of shared mobility.</p>
